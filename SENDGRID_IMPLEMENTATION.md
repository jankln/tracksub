## 🔧 Render Environment Variables

**Remove these:**
- ❌ EMAIL_HOST
- ❌ EMAIL_PORT
- ❌ EMAIL_USER
- ❌ EMAIL_PASS

**Keep/Add these:**
- ✅ SENDGRID_API_KEY (from SendGrid)
- ✅ EMAIL_FROM (verified email)
- ✅ NODE_ENV=production
- ✅ DATABASE_URL (already set)
- ✅ JWT_SECRET (already set)

## 🎯 Why This Will Work

**Old problem:** Render blocks SMTP ports (587, 465)
**New solution:** SendGrid uses HTTPS API - no ports blocked!

SendGrid API runs on port 443 (HTTPS), which Render never blocks.

---

## 📬 After Setup

Your users will receive email notifications:
- **From:** The email you verified in SendGrid
- **To:** Each user's registered email
- **When:** X days before their subscription payments (configurable)
- **Frequency:** Daily cron check at midnight UTC

---

## 💰 Cost

**FREE** - SendGrid gives 100 emails/day forever!
