# Cleanup Checklist

After successfully deploying with PostgreSQL, you can clean up old files:

## ✅ OLD DATABASE FILE DELETED!

The old `backend/src/database.ts` has been removed - it's no longer needed!

### What Was Deleted:
- ✅ `backend/src/database.ts` - Old SQLite database file (replaced by `models.ts`)

### Already Done For You:
The file has been deleted. You can now commit all changes together!

## Why Keep It For Now?

Keep `database.ts` until you verify:
- ✅ PostgreSQL connection works
- ✅ You can register and login
- ✅ You can create subscriptions
- ✅ Data persists after redeployment

Once everything works, then delete it!

## Don't Delete These!

These files are still needed:
- ✅ `models.ts` - New Sequelize models (keep!)
- ✅ All `.md` documentation files (keep for reference)
- ✅ `commit-db-changes.*` scripts (keep for future updates)

---

**Current Status**: Keep all files until PostgreSQL is verified working ✨
